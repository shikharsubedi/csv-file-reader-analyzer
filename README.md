# csv-file-reader-analyzer

This repo creates a loosely coupled csv file reader and analyzer in typescript. The csv file reader could be substituted by a Api file reader and it would work.
The application takes in a `football.csv` file which is a record of the soccer matches of English Premier League for the 2018/2019 season.
you can see the usage in the `./src/index.ts` file.

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
